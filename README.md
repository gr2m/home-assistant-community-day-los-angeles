## About the location

The Metaphor Club is creative space serving the communities of Leimert Park, Crenshaw, and Baldwin Hills since 2018. There are several food options close by, limited parking in the back, and great access through public transport using the [Metro K-Line Leimert Park station](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qesmgX4zNUnEy8sy5) and several bus stops.

## About the host

Gregor is a software engineer for over 20 years, Open Source maintainer, speaker, and host. He knew about Home Assistant before being interested in Home Automation due to their incredible success creating one of the most active Open Source project ever. And when building a new home for his family, two things were clear from the start: there will be a lot of Home Automation, and it will be done with Home Assistant.
