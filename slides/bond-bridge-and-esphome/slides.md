# Bond Bridge - Important Limitation

## State Synchronization Issue
**Problem**: Physical remote usage doesn't update Bond Bridge state

## Recommended Solution
- Use Home Assistant exclusively for device control
- Store physical remotes away from daily use
- Keep wall power switches in ON position
- Maintain state consistency through single control point
